"""Check the community catalog, which lists every pack, the AI-2 project's own
included.

Three layers, each stricter than the last:

  (none)     every entry complete, licences redistributable, ids unique,
             hashes the right shape, the maker named, categories, audience
             and ages taken from catalog/categories.yml
  --fetch    download each pack and check its size and SHA-256
  --install  install the downloaded pack with AI-2 itself and compare the
             manifest inside it against what the catalog entry claims

The third layer is the one that matters for a contributed pack: the hash only
proves the bytes are the ones the entry described, not that the entry
describes them truthfully. It needs the `ai2` package importable.

CI installs **v0.18.0 on purpose**, which is the oldest released ai-2 that
understands a pack's `revision`, so the check answers "does this artifact
install on the oldest AI-2 that knows about packs as they are now", not merely
"does it install here". Contributors build with a newer one (0.18.1 added
`ai-2 doc index --embedder`); that difference is the point, not an oversight.
Raise this baseline only when a pack-format change makes an older AI-2 unable
to install a current pack at all.

  pip install "ai2 @ git+https://github.com/ProWoos-Devs/ai-2@v0.18.0"
